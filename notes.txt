Checklist:

	1:15:37 - AppleXcpmCfgLock maybe we need to set it as True (depending if we have the option CFG_Lock on BIOS or not)
	1:18:00 - When using SMBIOS tool to populate config.plist, noticed that some XML entries on config.plist got messed up. Maybe it's worth checking this commit
		  and pick just the changes that are directly related to SMBIOS.
